<h1>Inline Styling</h1>
<p>Hey there, young web designer! Get ready to learn a super cool way to make your web pages look awesome—CSS inline styling! With CSS inline styling, you can bring colors, fonts, and other fancy styles to your web creations. It's like sprinkling magic directly onto your HTML elements!</p>
<br>

<p>So, what exactly is CSS inline styling? Well, remember that HTML is the building blocks of a web page—it's like the skeleton that holds everything together. CSS is the superpower that lets you dress up those HTML elements and make them stand out. And inline styling is a special way to add those styles right inside the HTML tags themselves.</p>
<br>

<p>Now, let's jump into how you can start using CSS inline styling. It's actually pretty simple! For each HTML element you want to style, you just need to add a special attribute called "style" to its opening tag. Inside that "style" attribute, you can write CSS code that will apply styles directly to that element.</p>
<br>
<p>For example, if you want to change the color of a heading to blue, you can add the following to the opening tag of the &lt;h1&gt;
element:</p>
<br>

<ol class="codeSnippet">
<li>&lt;h1 style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt;</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>See how the "style" attribute contains the CSS code? In this case, the code says that the color of the heading should be blue. And just like that, you've added some pizzazz to your web page!</p>
<br>
<p>But wait, there's more! CSS inline styling allows you to do so much more than just changing colors. You can adjust font sizes, make text bold or italic, add backgrounds, and even create borders around elements. It's like having a whole set of artistic tools right at your fingertips!</p>
<br>
<p>Remember, when using CSS inline styling, you need to include the CSS code within double quotes inside the "style" attribute. Each style you want to apply is separated by a semicolon (;). And don't forget the colon (:) between the property and its value!</p>
<br>
<p>One cool thing about inline styling is that you can apply different styles to different elements on the same page. Each element can have its own unique look! Just add the "style" attribute to the corresponding opening tag and let your creativity flow.</p>
