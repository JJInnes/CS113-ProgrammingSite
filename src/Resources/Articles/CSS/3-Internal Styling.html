<h1>Internal Styling</h1>
<p>Get ready to take your web pages to the next level with CSS internal stylesheets! With internal stylesheets, you can add fantastic styles to your web creations without cluttering your HTML. It's like having a secret notebook where you can jot down all your design ideas!</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>So, what exactly is a CSS internal stylesheet? Well, you already know that HTML is the foundation of a web page, like the framework of a house. CSS is the creative part that adds colors, fonts, and other cool styles to make your website look awesome. And an internal stylesheet is a special section within your HTML file where you can write all your CSS code.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Now, let's dive into how you can start using CSS internal stylesheets. It's really exciting! Inside your HTML file, you need to add a special tag called &lt;style&gt;. This tag acts as a container for your CSS code. You place it between the &lt;head&gt; and &lt;/head&gt; tags, just like this:</p>
<ol class="codeSnippet">
<li>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</li>
<li>&lt;html&gt;</li>
<li>  &lt;head&gt;</li>
<li>    &lt;title&gt;My First Web Page&lt;/title&gt;</li>
<li>  &lt;/head&gt;</li>
<li>  &lt;body&gt;</li>
<li>    &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to my Web Page!&lt;/h1&gt;</li>
<li>    &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph of text.&lt;/p&gt;</li>
<li>    &lt;img src=&quot;image.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My Image&quot;&gt;</li>
<li>    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.example.com&quot;&gt;Click here to visit Example.com&lt;/a&gt;</li>
<li>  &lt;/body&gt;</li>
<li>&lt;/html&gt;</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>Within the &lt;style&gt; tags, you can unleash your creativity and write CSS code to style your web page. You can change colors, fonts, sizes, and so much more! It's like having a magical pen to bring your design ideas to life.</p>
<br>
<p>For example, if you want to make all the paragraphs on your web page have a red color, you can add the following CSS code within the &lt;style&gt; tags:</p>

<ol class="codeSnippet">
<li>&lt;style&gt;</li>
<li>  p {</li>
<li>    color: red;</li>
<li>  }</li>
<li>&lt;/style&gt;</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>See how the CSS code is written inside the &lt;style&gt; tags? In this case, we're targeting all the &lt;p&gt; elements (paragraphs) and saying that they should have a red color. And just like that, you've added a touch of style to your web page!</p>
<br>
<p>One cool thing about internal stylesheets is that you can apply different styles to different elements on the same page. You can target specific elements by using their HTML tags, like &lt;h1&gt; for headings or &lt;a&gt; for links. It's like having a superpower that lets you customize each part of your web page individually!</p>
