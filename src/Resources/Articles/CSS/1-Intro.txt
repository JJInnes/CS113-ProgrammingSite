So, what exactly is CSS? Well, think of a website like a canvas, and HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the structure that defines the different elements on that canvas, like headings, paragraphs, images, and buttons. CSS is like the magic paintbrush that adds style and personality to those elements, making them look eye-catching and unique.

CSS works by selecting HTML elements and giving them special styles. You can choose the colors, sizes, fonts, and even the positions of different elements on your web page. It's like being a master decorator, but for websites! By using CSS, you can turn a plain and ordinary website into something extraordinary.
