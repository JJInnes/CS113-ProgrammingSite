So, what exactly is CSS inline styling? Well, remember that HTML is the building blocks of a web page—it's like the skeleton that holds everything together.

Now, let's jump into how you can start using CSS inline styling. It's actually pretty simple! For each HTML element you want to style, you just need to add a special attribute called "style" to its opening tag. Inside that "style" attribute, you can write CSS code that will apply styles directly to that element.
