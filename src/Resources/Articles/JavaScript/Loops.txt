What if we want to do something many times, but don’t want to copy and paste the code over and over. What if we want the program to be able to decide how many times to do it? This is the purpose of loops.
There are two important types of loop in Javascript: WHILE and FOR.
WHILE loops are similar to IF statements in that they take a condition and have a block of code:
while(){

}
The program checks the condition, if it is true – it runs the loop, then checks the condition again, then runs the loop, and so on. If the condition is ever false, the loop ends and the program continues to whatever comes after the loop. It is VERY important that somewhere in the loop there is a way for the condition of the loop to become false, otherwise the loop will never end.

FOR loops are better for looping a fixed number of times. The syntax for FOR loops is a little mor complicated:
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
	console.log(i)
}
FOR loops have 3 statements in their parenthesis, an initial statement that runs when the loop starts, a condition to check if the loop should run again, and a line that runs at the end of each loop.
Above, the initial statement is "var i = 0" which creates a variable , i, to keep track of the current iteration.
The condition is "i < 5", which if true will cause the loop to run again.
"i++" increments i at the end of each loop, effectivly counting the iterations.
Together, this means the loop will run 5 times before stopping, and will return the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 to the console.

A good rule of thumb, if you know how many times to loop, use a FOR, if not, use a WHILE.
