<p>Functions allow us to take a section of code, simplify it into an input and an output, give it a name and then use it later without worrying about the details. This is a method of abstraction, a concept used to make large programs manageable.</p>
<br>
<p>Abstraction is all about hiding detail, and thatâ€™s what functions do. Functions contain a block of code that is executed whenever the function is called. You can give them parameters, which are essentially inputs, and they can return a value. Essentially, they are a process, with an input and output.</p>
<br>
<p>Lets start out with a very simple function:</p>
<ol class="codeSnippet">
    <li>function helloWorld(){</li>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log("Hello World");</li>
	<li>}</li>
</ol>
<p>Which can be called as follows:</p>
<ol class="codeSnippet">
    <li>helloWorld();</li>
</ol>
<p>This would return "Hello World" to the console</p>
<br>
<p>You can add parameters and a return statement to a function to create inputs and outputs:</p>
<ol class="codeSnippet">
    <li>function add (a, b){</li>
	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;return a + b;</li>
	<li>}</li>
	<li> </li>
	<li>var total = add(5, 15);</li>
</ol>
<p>Would set the value of total to 20.</p>
