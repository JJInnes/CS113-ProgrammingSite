The purpose of HTML is structuring the webpage, It gives it structure and tells the browser how everything should be arranged.

In HTML, we use special codes called "tags" to create different elements on a web page. Think of these tags as building blocks. Each tag has a special job, like making headings, paragraphs, images, and links.

An example of what a basic HTML document might look like can be seen below

<html>
   <head>
      <title>Hello World!, this is a title</title>
   </head>

   <body>
      <h1>Hello World!, this is a heading</h1>
      <p>Hello World!, this is a paragraph</p>
   </body>
</html>

You will notice looking at the document above that it is structured in layers. First we have out head tag, this contains the title for out HTML document.
Next we have the body tag, this is where most of the content of the webpage should go.
