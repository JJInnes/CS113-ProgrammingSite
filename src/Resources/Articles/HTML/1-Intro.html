<p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. Don't let the big words scare you! HTML is a special language that is used to create web pages. </p>
<p>Think of it as a magical tool that helps us build amazing things on the internet.</p>
<br>
<p>In HTML, we use something called "tags" to create elements. Tags are like building blocks that tell the computer what each part of our web page should be. </p>
<p>For example, the &lt;h1&gt; tag creates a big heading, and the &lt;p&gt; tag creates a paragraph.</p>
