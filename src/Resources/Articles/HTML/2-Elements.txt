The purpose of the tag is to let the browser know this is a HTML document it also lets the browser know what version of HTML we are using.

You will notice that the name of the tag is enclosed in <>. All tags are contained within arrow brackets and further down the document require a similar closing tag. 
For out doc type tag this looks like this...
